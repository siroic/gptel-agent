#+title: gptel-agent

This is a collection of tools and prompts to use [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]] "agentically" with any
LLM, to autonomously perform tasks.

It has access to
- the web (via basic web search, URL fetching and YouTube video metadata),
- local files (read/write/edit),
- the state of Emacs (documentation and Elisp evaluation),
- and Bash, if you are in a POSIX-y environment.

By default, all actions except for web search, fetching URLs and reading local
files require confirmation.  You can change this, add more tools and MCP servers
etc as in regular gptel usage.

gptel-agent can also delegate tasks to specialized "sub-agents" which don't
share context with the main session.  In this demo, gptel-agent delegates a
research task to two different sub-agents, who perform it in parallel and
generate reports that gptel-agent uses to answer the question:

*** How to install

gptel-agent is on MELPA, so you can run =M-x package-install= ⏎ =gptel-agent= in Emacs.

#+html: </details>
#+html: <details><summary>
**** Manual
#+html: </summary>

Clone or download this repository and run =M-x package-install-file⏎= on the
repository directory.

Or from =use-package= (Emacs 30+):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package gptel-agent
  :vc ( :url "https://github.com/karthink/gptel-agent"
        :rev :newest)
  :config (gptel-agent-update))         ;Read files from agents directories
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Or from =use-package=:

  :config (gptel-agent-update))         ;Read files from agents directories

*** How to use:

- Important: ensure that gptel is up to date, and not just the latest stable release!

- Set =gptel-model= and =gptel-backend= to use your preferred LLM.  See [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel's
  README]] for details.

There are two ways to use gptel-agent:

**** In a dedicated session

- Run M-x =gptel-agent=.  This will open a gptel buffer in the current project
  with the agent preset loaded.  Run with a prefix arg for more options.

- Use gptel as usual, calling =gptel-send= etc.

- If you change the system prompt, tools or other settings in this buffer, you
  can reset the agent configuration by (re)applying the "gptel-agent" preset
  from gptel's menu.

- You can switch between an agent preset (gptel-agent) and a planning preset
  (gptel-plan) by applying them from gptel's menu, or clicking on the backend
  name in the header line.

  The difference between them is just in the tools available to the model -- the
  planning preset has read-only access to the filesystem and is instructed to
  create a systematic plan of action.

**** Anywhere in Emacs

Place =(gptel-agent-update)= in your config.

As with gptel, you can use gptel-agent in any buffer, including read-only
buffers and the minibuffer.

- Apply the "gptel-agent" preset in the buffer from gptel's menu.

- OR include =@gptel-agent= in a prompt to send only that prompt with the agent
  capabilities.

Please note: gptel-agent uses significantly more tokens than the average
gptel LLM interaction.

*** What is an "agent"?

"Agent" is the (now common) parlance used to refer to a bundle of configuration,
consisting of

- a system prompt (instructions),
- tools (functions the LLM can call)
- and the harness used to run or call the LLM.

gptel uses the term "preset" for such configurations.  A preset can specify the above and any other behavior, such as the model used, API call parameters and so on.

=gptel-agent= is implemented as a preset for gptel and can be modified/extended easily.

*** Using sub-agents

gptel-agent can delegate tasks to "sub-agents".  Sub-agents can be specified in
Markdown or Org files in a directory.  To see how to specify agents, examine the
"agents" directory in this package (or see below).  You can add your directory
of agents to =gptel-agent-dirs=, which see.

Right now gptel-agent includes three sub-agents:
- =executor= is a copy of the main LLM, directed to work autonomously and
  noninteractively, returning a final response.
- =researcher= is read-only and can search the web or through local files for
  information.
- =introspector= can examine the state of Emacs, and access or search
  documentation from your live Emacs session.

The LLM should automatically delegate tasks to them as required, but you can
also explicitly request delegation: "/Use the researcher to find out if.../" or
"/Use my-custom-agent to.../".

#+html: <details><summary>
**** Why?
#+html: </summary>

LLMs often run into dead-ends when trying things, and this can both bloat and
pollute the context window.  Sub-agents don't share any context with the main
session and return relatively concise reports that gptel-agent can refer to.

Sub-agents can be provided with tools specific to their task, which improves the
quality of the result.  They can also be restricted accordingly by, for example,
providing read-only access to resources.

Sub-agents can be configured to use specific models or other API parameters
(like the level of reasoning) independent of gptel-agent.  They are essentially
gptel presets.

**** Agents from Markdown files
#+html: </summary>

gptel-agent reads agent specs from files in =gptel-agent-dirs=, which you can
customize.

You can specify the agent name, description and tools used as YAML front-matter
in a Markdown file, followed by the system prompt:

#+begin_src markdown
---
name: arxiv-explorer
description: Searches ArXiv and parses results
tools: [mcp-arxiv, WebSearch]
pre: (lambda () (gptel-mcp-connect '(arxiv) 'sync))
---

You are a specialized research agent with access to ArXiv.  Your purpose is to
search for and gather information efficiently.

<core_responsibilites> ...  </core_responsibilities>

...
#+end_src

=name= defaults to the file name, so only the =description= is mandatory.
=tools= is a list of tool names or categories.

You can specify any other keys that gptel recognizes as preset keys, including a
specific model, backend and API parameters.  See =gptel-make-preset= for
details.

In the above example, the =:pre= key is an elisp function that runs before the
agent is called.  I am assuming a tool category named "mcp-arxiv" is provided by
the "arxiv" MCP server.

**** Agents from Org files
#+html: </summary>

gptel-agent reads agent specs from files in =gptel-agent-dirs=, which you can customize.

You can specify the agent name, description and tools used in an Org properties
block at the top of an Org file, followed by the system prompt:

#+begin_src org
:properties:
:name: arxiv-explorer
:description: Searches ArXiv and parses results
:tools: mcp-arxiv WebSearch
:pre: (lambda () (gptel-mcp-connect '(arxiv) 'sync))
:end:
